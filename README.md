# opay - Flutter 

Just attempting to clone this project using `Django` for the `backend` because I was inspired by the Opay app. After examining their homepage, I noticed that their icons and assets are custom and not visible on their website. I decided to reverse-engineer their app, but after going through it, I felt discouraged and decided to abandon the project. I discussed this in the [Black Stack Hub Whatsapp Group](https://blackstackhub.com). I spent only two days on this project, and by the night of the second day, my research led to discouragement. Below are a few screenshots from the group chat.

### Not interested again reason:

**Not interested reasons:**
1. time(limited)
2. too much pages
3. soft and wide(i expect hard)
4. webapp(i am using flutter)
5. anyone can do it (its easy)
6. too much API
7. version control
8. private(didn't tell unless u go in) Open Source(bcus everything has API and no ONLY its ANYONE)




In below screenshot you will find my little search about anyone did Opay clone before then why not interested anymore and some other pains
